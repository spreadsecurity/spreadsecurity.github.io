      <p>Port scanning is a technique used to identify if a port on the target host is open or closed; a port can be open if there is a service that uses that specific port to communicate with other systems. This is the reason why if a port is open it is possible to eventually identify what kind of service uses it by sending specially crafted packets to the target.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up a testing environment</strong></p>

<p>Since we need a target against which we can launch our port scanning attacks, we need to create a very basic testing laboratory that includes our attacking machine, in my case Kali Linux, and a target machine: for this lab session I suggest to download a VM called Metasploitable 2. This system, created by Metasploit team, has been build intentionally vulnerable to a series of attacks by exposing compromised services through open ports.<br />
The virtual machine can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/">here</a>; because of its nature, do not expose this VM on the Internet, i.e. be sure to run it in a local network environment behind a Router Firewall.</p>

<p>Once the VM image is downloaded it is just a matter of extracting the files from the archive and import it in your Hypervisor: for example, in VMware Workstation Player click on “Open a Virtual Machine”, select the extracted Metasploitable 2 image and you are ready to launch it. If everything has been done correctly you should get this terminal prompt:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="/images/port_scanning/metasploitable2.png"><img src="/images/port_scanning/metasploitable2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Remember to configure it so as its IP address is in the same LAN of the attacking machine (in my case the LAN is 192.168.1.0/24).</p>

<p><strong>Port scanning Metasploitable 2</strong></p>

<p>Nmap, which we have already analyzed for Network Discovery in <a href="https://spreadsecurity.github.io/2016/09/25/network-discovery-with-nmap-and-netdiscover.html">this</a> topic, is the most famous tool for port scanning: by sending probes to the target it is able to find which ports are open and which services are running on them (this is just one of its capabilities).</p>

<p>We can start by taking a look at the huge list of scanning options:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>SCAN TECHNIQUES:

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Even if we will not go through all of them, we will analyze the most useful ones.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to know to start a scan is the IP address of the target host. We could easily acquire that by simply logging into the just launched Metasploitable VM and then using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> command, but, since we want to mimic the actions of a real attacker that has no direct access to the machine, we have to move in a different way.<br />
Remembering the previous post we can either use Nmap or Netdiscover for this matter: <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24</code> will do the job. We discover that Metasploitable 2 machine has IP address 192.168.1.100 (by default the IP address is assigned by DHCP, but we can set a static IP address modifying <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/network/interfaces</code>).</p>

<p>Once we know the target IP address we can launch the port scanning attack. By default, if no option is selected, Nmap runs a TCP SYN Scan also known as Stealth Scan.</p>

<p><strong>TCP 3-Way Handshake</strong></p>

<p>To understand this type of scan it can be useful to refresh the TCP 3-way handshake theory which represents the way a TCP connection starts:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="/images/port_scanning/3wayhandshake.png"><img src="/images/port_scanning/3wayhandshake.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>When a system A wants to establish a connection with another system B, A sends a SYN (Synchronize) packet to B; when B receives the message it sends back to A a SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknoledgement). Once A receives that signal, it sends to B an ACK. Finally B receives the ACK and the TCP socket connection is established.</p>

<p><strong>TCP Scan</strong></p>

<p>A TCP SYN Scan works this way: system A, that represents our attacking machine, sends to the target system B the SYN and waits for the SYN-ACK. If B responds, which means the port is open, A does not send the final ACK. If A does not receive the SYN-ACK the port can be either closed or filtered (this can indicate the presence of a Firewall). In this way we have performed a TCP port scan without establishing a full connection with the target.<br />
Resuming and detailing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open port: A sends SYN to B and B responds with SYN-ACK;</li>
  <li>Closed port: A sends SYN to B and B responds with RST-ACK (Reset-Acknoledgement);</li>
  <li>Filtered port: A sends SYN to B, but does not receive a response or receives an ICMP port unreachable error message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if this type of scan is the default one, we can set it up with the “-sS” parameter followed by the IP address of the target:</p>

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.20 seconds
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Nmap, if not specified differently, sets the scan to probe the most common 1000 ports and goes through them in a random way (“-r” option for scanning ports consecutively).
As we can see from the results, we have scanned 1000 ports in 0.20 seconds and 977 of them are reported as closed; for the opened ones, Nmap gives us information about the service that is running on them.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic analysis with Wireshark</strong></p>

<p>We can inspect Nmap SYN Scan activity with Wireshark by launching it and then running the port scan:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="/images/port_scanning/wireshark_synscan.png"><img src="/images/port_scanning/wireshark_synscan.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In the above image it is clear the attacking machine probes target ports by sending SYN packets: for example, we can look at the packet number 21 which probes port 22 (SSH service) and receives a SYN-ACK at packet number 31 meaning the port is open. The ones highlighted in red are RST-ACK meaning that specific port is closed.</p>

<p><strong>A more aggressive port scan</strong></p>

<p>We can add some parameters to acquire additional details about the version of services running on those open ports (“-sV”) and to identify the Operating System (“-O”). We can also specify we want to scan not only the top 1000 ports, but all of them (“-p 1-65535”). Finally we can set up a time aggressive scan with “-T4”, since we do not care of being detected in a testing lab environment (the less the number after “T” the bigger the time between the probes).
Of course, because this is a more complex scan, it will take more time to execute w.r.t the previous one:</p>

</div>

<p>As reported above, we have details about services version: for example, we now know that the ftp server running on Metasploitable 2 is vsftpd (Very Secure FTPD) version 2.3.4.
Moreover we got the Operating System which is Linux and the Kernel version detected as 2.6.x (between 2.6.9 and 2.6.33).<br />
Keep in mind that an aggressive scan is more likely to be detected and there is also the possibility that it brings down the service that runs on the corresponding scanned port.</p>

<p><strong>UDP Scan</strong></p>

<p>Until now we have performed TCP port scan. UDP scan is really different since UDP is a connectionless protocol. It can happen that even if a UDP port is open it might not respond to any received UDP packet. During a UDP scan the attacker machine sends a UDP packet to the target port: if the port is open the attacker machine receives a response; if the port is closed Nmap receives an ICMP port unreachable message. If the attacker machine does not receive any response there are two possibilities: the port is open but the service is not responding to Nmap probes or the traffic is filtered due to the presence of a Firewall.</p>

<p>A UDP scan can be launched with the option “-sU”:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@kali:~# nmap -sU 192.168.1.100

Starting Nmap 7.30 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-10-22 20:14 CEST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1082.85 seconds
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As reported, we have scanned 1000 ports and 994 of them are identified as closed. As stated before, when Nmap does not receive any response it classifies the port either as open or filtered. Moreover UDP scan is time consuming: 1082.85 seconds, which are about 18 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting</strong></p>

<p>An interesting feature is the possibility to report results into different formats like XML. In particular, it is useful to convert XML results into HTML files, so they can be displayed in your favourite Web Browser.<br />
The following command generates the XML report, process it and gives as output the HTML file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.1.100 -oX metasploitable_scan.xml &amp;&amp; xsltproc metasploitable_scan.xml -o metasploitable_report.html
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And this is the HTML report:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="/images/port_scanning/nmap_metasploitable_report.png"><img src="/images/port_scanning/nmap_metasploitable_report.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>We have seen how Nmap can perform both TCP and UDP port scan; it is a really good tool to identify open ports on the target system and which services are running on them. We have also seen how it is possible to discover target services versions and O.S. through a more agressive scan. The results reporting capability has been showed with an example of HTML report.<br />
There are a lot of other interesting features inside this tool and we will take a look at them in the next lab sessions.</p>
