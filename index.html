        <p>Malware, in general, is any kind of malicious program which executes on a machine; it can be used for a large variety of purposes such as influence computer behavior, display ads, steal personal informations, take control of remote machines and so on.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>During a penetration test, a big part of the success in the exploitation phase depends from how good the information gathering was performed. Since this activity, especially when dealing with a huge amount of informations, is time consuming, it is a good idea to rely on tools which make reconnaissance in automated way.</p>

<p>Recon-ng is an incredibly powerful tool for Open Source Intelligence Gathering (OSINT); actually, it is a reconnaissance framework written in Python built with a Metasploit like usage model (we will see what Metasploit is further on, for now it is enough to know that it is the most famous penetration testing framework).</p>

        <p>Today a large number of devices are connected to Internet, from smartphones or watches to air-conditioning devices or even refrigerators: this is what has been called “Internet of Things” (IoT), i.e. the network composed by physical devices collecting and exchanging data between themselves.</p>

        <p>Generally, when we want to search for a particular argument, we open up our favourite browser, navigate to a Web Search Engine and type in some words related to that matter. Depending from how good we set up the research, we obtain more or less pertinent results.</p>

<p>Basically, everytime we launch a search we make a query to the web search engine: there are some particular expressions known to the engine, called Advanced Search Operators, which make a search more effective. Queries built like these are also called “Google dorks”.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>Following a portion of the phases presented in the Penetration Testing Execution Standards (PTES), which represents a technical guideline for performing a penetration test, i.e. a simulation of a real attack against a certain target, we will focus on the theory and practice behind the following main steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information gathering or reconnaissance;</li>
  <li>Vulnerability analysis;</li>
  <li>Exploitation;</li>
  <li>Post-exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since these steps mimic how the attacker thinks and acts, performing this process via previous authorization is also called “Ethical Hacking”.</p>

        <p>The title of this blog is pretty self-explanatory: “Spread Security”, in other words, share knowledge to increase awareness.</p>

<p>The reason why I started this project is because Information Security is a very interesting argument which is getting more and more critical as time goes by due to the growing presence of devices on the Internet.</p>

<p>In this scenario it is important to understand what type of attacks are in the wild and how to secure our devices, i.e. our data, from malicious users trying to steal personal informations such as credentials and documents.</p>
